# UAV_image_recognition

The intention of this project is to enable a UAV to recognize its path through image recognization. Therefore, I used Keras to build a very simple model which will enable the UAV to know when to turn left, turn right or go straight according to the image it receives. After running for 10 epochs on my laptop, I was able to achieve 90% accuracy. I only used 3000 images for training, 1000 for each class, and 1200 images for testing, 400 for each class. The images are obtained from here : http://people.idsia.ch/~guzzi/DataSet.html


Feel free to form your own dataset and test them against this model!
